## Documentation of `messages.properties`

This file serves as a default localization file for messages used in a web application. It defines key-value pairs where the key represents the message identifier and the value is its default English translation. If a more specific localization file (e.g., `messages_es.properties` for Spanish) exists, those translations will override the default values defined here.

**Overview:**

The file provides localized messages for various application functionalities, such as error messages, success notifications, and form validation messages. It acts as a fallback when no more specific localization files are found.

**Key Properties:**

* **Each line in the file represents a property:** It follows the format "key=value", where "key" is the message identifier and "value" is its default English translation.

**Pseudo Code:**

1. **Load Property File:**
   - Read the content of the `messages.properties` file.
2. **Parse Property Pairs:**
   - Iterate through each line in the file.
   - Split each line into "key" and "value" based on the "=" delimiter.
3. **Store Translations:**
   - Create a data structure (e.g., a map or dictionary) to store the message translations.
   - Use the "key" as the key and the "value" as the corresponding default English translation in the data structure.



**Dependencies:**

* **Property File Parsing:** The code relies on a mechanism to read and parse the property file. This could be achieved using built-in language features or a dedicated library for property file handling.
