## Documentation of `Vet.java`

This Java class represents a veterinarian in the Spring PetClinic application. It extends the `Person` class, inheriting basic person information, and adds specific attributes and methods related to veterinary specialties.

**Overview:**

The `Vet` class defines a veterinarian's data, including their name and specialties. It uses JPA annotations to map the class to a database table and defines relationships with `Specialty` objects. The class also provides methods for retrieving, adding, and managing specialties associated with a veterinarian.

**Key Properties and Methods:**

* **`specialties`:** A `Set` of `Specialty` objects representing the veterinarian's areas of expertise.
* **`getSpecialtiesInternal()`:**  A protected method to access the internal `specialties` set. It returns a new HashSet if the set is null.
* **`setSpecialtiesInternal()`:** A protected method to set the `specialties` set.
* **`getSpecialties()`:** A public method that returns a sorted list of `Specialty` objects associated with the veterinarian. It sorts the specialties alphabetically by name.
* **`getNrOfSpecialties()`:** A public method that returns the number of specialties associated with the veterinarian.
* **`addSpecialty(Specialty specialty)`:** A public method to add a new `Specialty` to the veterinarian's list of specialties.


**Dependencies and Assumptions:**

* **Spring Data JPA:** This class relies on Spring Data JPA for database interaction and persistence.
* **JPA Annotations:** The class uses JPA annotations like `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@ManyToMany`, and `@JoinTable` to define its mapping to the database.
* **`Specialty` Class:** The `Vet` class assumes the existence of a `Specialty` class representing veterinary specialties.



**Pseudo Code:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - If `specialties` is null, create a new HashSet and assign it to `specialties`.

2. **`getSpecialties()`:**
   - Create a new ArrayList from `specialties`.
   - Sort the ArrayList of `Specialty` objects alphabetically by name using `PropertyComparator`.
   - Return an unmodifiable list of sorted `Specialty` objects.

3. **`getNrOfSpecialties()`:**
   - Return the size of the `specialties` set.

4. **`addSpecialty(Specialty specialty)`:**
   - Add the given `Specialty` object to the `specialties` set.



**Edge Cases and Error Handling:**

* The code assumes that `Specialty` objects are properly defined and available.
* No explicit error handling is present in the provided code.
