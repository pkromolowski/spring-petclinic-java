## Documentation of PetTypeFormatter.java

**Overview:**

The `PetTypeFormatter` class is a Spring component responsible for handling the formatting and parsing of `PetType` objects within a Spring MVC application. It implements the `Formatter` interface, allowing Spring to use this class to convert between `PetType` objects and their string representations. This is crucial for displaying and inputting `PetType` values in web forms and other user interfaces.

**Dependencies:**

* **Spring Framework:** Required for dependency injection (`@Autowired`) and utilizing the `Formatter` interface.
* **OwnerRepository:** An interface for accessing `PetType` data from the database.


**Methods:**

* **`PetTypeFormatter(OwnerRepository owners)`:**
    * **Description:** Constructor that initializes the formatter with an instance of `OwnerRepository`.
    * **Parameters:**
        * `owners`: An instance of `OwnerRepository` used to retrieve `PetType` objects from the database.
    * **Return Value:** None.

* **`print(PetType petType, Locale locale)`:**
    * **Description:** Converts a `PetType` object to its string representation.
    * **Parameters:**
        * `petType`: The `PetType` object to be converted.
        * `locale`: The current locale for formatting purposes.
    * **Return Value:** A string representation of the `PetType` object, which is its name.

* **`parse(String text, Locale locale)`:**
    * **Description:** Converts a string representation of a `PetType` to a `PetType` object.
    * **Parameters:**
        * `text`: The string representation of the `PetType` to be parsed.
        * `locale`: The current locale for parsing purposes.
    * **Return Value:** A `PetType` object corresponding to the input string.
    * **Logic:**
        * Retrieves all `PetType` objects from the database using `OwnerRepository`.
        * Iterates through the retrieved `PetType` objects and compares their names with the input string.
        * If a match is found, returns the corresponding `PetType` object.
        * If no match is found, throws a `ParseException` indicating that the type was not found.

**Data Structures:**

* **`PetType`:** Represents a type of pet (e.g., "Dog", "Cat", "Bird").
* **`OwnerRepository`:** A Spring Data JPA repository interface for interacting with the `PetType` entity in the database.



**Pseudo Code:**

1. **Initialization:**
    * Create a `PetTypeFormatter` object, passing in an `OwnerRepository` instance.
2. **String to PetType Conversion (parse method):**
    * Retrieve all `PetType` objects from the database.
    * Iterate through each `PetType` object.
    * Compare the name of the current `PetType` object with the input string.
    * If a match is found:
        * Return the corresponding `PetType` object.
    * If no match is found after iterating through all `PetType` objects:
        * Throw a `ParseException` indicating that the type was not found.
3. **PetType to String Conversion (print method):**
    * Return the name of the `PetType` object.



**Edge Cases and Error Handling:**

* The `parse` method handles the case where a `PetType` with the given name is not found by throwing a `ParseException`.
