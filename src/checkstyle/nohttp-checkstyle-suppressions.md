## Documentation of `nohttp-checkstyle-suppressions.xml`

This XML file defines suppressions for the `NoHttp` Checkstyle rule within a larger project.  It specifies which files and patterns are exempt from the `NoHttp` rule's checks.

**Key Variables and Data Structures:**

* **`suppressions`:** The root element of the file, containing all suppression rules.

* **`suppress`:** An element representing a single suppression rule. It has the following attributes:

    * **`files`:** A pattern matching file paths that will be suppressed.
    * **`checks`:** A pattern matching Checkstyle checks that will be suppressed within the matched files.

**Assumptions and Dependencies:**

* **Checkstyle Plugin:** The code assumes that a Checkstyle plugin is already configured within the project.
* **NoHttp Check:** It relies on the `NoHttp` Checkstyle rule to enforce specific coding conventions related to HTTP requests and handling.

**Pseudo Code:**

1. **Define Suppressions:**
   - Create a `suppressions` element.
   - For each file or file pattern to be suppressed:
     - Create a `suppress` element.
     - Set the `files` attribute to the pattern matching the file(s) to suppress.
     - Set the `checks` attribute to `.*` to suppress all Checkstyle rules within the matched files.

2. **File Patterns:**
   - The `files` attribute uses wildcard patterns to match specific files or directories:
     - `node_modules[\\/].*`: Suppresses all files within the `node_modules` directory and its subdirectories.
     - `node[\\/].*`: Suppresses all files within the `node` directory and its subdirectories.
     - `build[\\/].*`: Suppresses all files within the `build` directory and its subdirectories.
     - `target[\\/].*`: Suppresses all files within the `target` directory and its subdirectories.
     - `.+\\.(jar|git|ico|p12|gif|jks|jpg|svg|log)`: Suppresses all files with the specified extensions.

**Edge Cases and Error Handling:**

* The code assumes that the `NoHttp` rule and its configuration are defined elsewhere within the project.

* The wildcard patterns used in `files` might need adjustments based on the specific directory structure of the project.
